\description{
Smart CRUD function that automatically determines which operation to perform
(CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) based on old_value and new_value.
}
\details{
Decision logic:
\itemize{
\item old_value is NA/empty + new_value has value → CREATE (add)
\item old_value has value + new_value has different value → UPDATE
\item old_value has value + new_value is NA/empty → DELETE (remove)
\item old_value is NA/empty + new_value is NA/empty → SKIP
}

Required columns:
attachable_id - id of the person / company
attachable_type - "people" or "companies"
field_name - custom_fields_type_id (the field type ID)
old_value - current value (NA if field doesn't exist)
new_value - desired value (NA to delete field)
custom_fields_id - id of the custom_field instance (NA if doesn't exist, required for UPDATE/DELETE)
}

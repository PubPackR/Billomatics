}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing contract data. Must include the columns:
\code{client_id}, \code{confirmation_number}, \code{order_date},
\code{service_start}, and \code{service_end}.}

\description{
This function adds a column \code{is_first_order} to the provided dataframe.
It classifies contracts as first order (TRUE) or follow-up order (FALSE)
based on the gap between the previous contract's service end date and the current order date.
}
\details{
A contract is classified as first order (TRUE) if:
\enumerate{
\item The client has no previous contracts within the dataset.
\item The gap between the previous contract's \code{service_end} and the
current \code{order_date} is greater than 24 months (indicating no revenue
in the preceding 24 months).
}
Otherwise, it is classified as follow-up order (FALSE).

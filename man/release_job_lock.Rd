\usage{
release_job_lock(con, job_name)

\description{
Releases a PostgreSQL advisory lock previously acquired for the given job name.
Should be called after job completion or in cleanup handlers (on.exit).
}
\details{
This function uses PostgreSQL's pg_advisory_unlock(). The lock ID must match
the one used in acquire_job_lock() (derived from CRC32 hash of job_name).
Attempting to release a lock not held by the current session will generate
a warning from PostgreSQL but will not error.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
con <- postgres_connect(needed_tables = c("processed.data_job_events"))

if (acquire_job_lock(con, "daily_export")) {
  on.exit(release_job_lock(con, "daily_export"))
  # ... run job ...
}
}
}
